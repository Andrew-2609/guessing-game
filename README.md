# Guessing Game with C

This is a simple guessing game made up with the C language. It was used to learn some fundamentals of the language, such as variable types, conditionals, loops, and so on.

To run it on a Linux machine, you can simply use `gcc` compiler to compile the game C file in your terminal:

`gcc game.c -o {output path}`

And then run the output file by inputting its path in the terminal.

`paht/to/output_file`

You'll se a message telling you to choose a *difficulty*. **There is no error handling in this project.**
